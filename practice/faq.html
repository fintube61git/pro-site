      <p><em>This page answers common questions about how therapy works, who it’s for, and what to expect. You can scroll or jump to the sections most relevant to you.</em></p>
      <h3>Where are you located?</h3>
      <p>All sessions are held online using secure video.</p>
      <p>I work with adults who are physically located in Oregon at the time of the session.</p>
      <h3>Do you prescribe medication?</h3>
      <p>No, I do not prescribe medication.</p>
      <p>If, at some point, medication seems worth considering, I can refer you to trusted psychiatrists or nurse practitioners and, if helpful, coordinate care with them. Medication is never treated as the first or only option.</p>
      <h3>How do I know if this will be a good fit?</h3>
      <p>A good therapy fit matters, and it usually takes some time to know.</p>
      <p>Most people have a clearer sense within the first two or three sessions. During that time, we pay attention to whether you feel heard, whether the pace feels right, and whether the work feels supportive rather than pressured.</p>
      <p>You are always welcome to say if something doesn’t feel helpful or to ask for adjustments. Therapy works best when it stays open and collaborative.</p>
      <h3>What if I’m not sure what I want to work on?</h3>
      <p>That’s very common.</p>
      <p>Many people come to therapy with a sense that something isn’t working, even if they can’t clearly name it yet. Part of the work is slowing down and making sense of what’s happening, rather than rushing toward answers.</p>
      <h3>Do you take insurance?</h3>
      <p>Yes and no—depending on how you work with me.</p>
      <p>I offer private-pay therapy through my independent practice, Existenz Psychotherapy.</p>
      <p>I also provide insurance-based therapy through a separate group practice.</p>
      <p>Insurance plans, scheduling, and billing are handled through the group practice. Private-pay therapy is separate and not billed to insurance.</p>
      <p>Details about how to schedule under each option are available on the Contact page.</p>
      <h3>What is therapy with you like?</h3>
      <p>Therapy with me is collaborative, steady, and paced to you.</p>
      <p>We focus on understanding patterns in your life and inner experience—especially ones that no longer feel helpful. Rather than trying to fix or get rid of parts of you, we work to understand them and make room for more choice and flexibility.</p>
      <p>Sessions usually start with what feels most important to you that day. We end by briefly checking in about what was helpful and what might work better next time.</p>
      <h3>What is therapy with you not like?</h3>
      <p>Therapy with me is not:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Advice-driven or prescriptive</li>
        <li>Rushed or agenda-heavy</li>
        <li>Focused on “fixing” you</li>
        <li>Centered only on diagnoses or symptoms</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The work is about understanding, choice, and change—not performance or compliance.</p>
      <h2>Who This Work Is For</h2>
      <p>This work may be a good fit if you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Want to understand yourself better, even if parts of your experience feel confusing</li>
        <li>Feel stuck in patterns you want to change</li>
        <li>Are going through a transition, loss, identity shift, or period of uncertainty</li>
        <li>Have a history of trauma and want therapy that moves at a respectful pace</li>
        <li>Prefer a collaborative approach rather than being told what to do</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You don’t need to have clear goals or answers to begin. Curiosity and honesty are enough.</p>
      <h2>Who This Work May Not Be For</h2>
      <p>This approach may not be the best fit if you are looking for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Very directive or advice-focused therapy</li>
        <li>Quick symptom-fixing without much reflection</li>
        <li>A structured program with step-by-step instructions</li>
        <li>Therapy that relies heavily on labels or diagnoses</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If this isn’t the right fit, I’m happy to help you think about other options.</p>
      <h2>What You Can Expect from Therapy</h2>
      <p>You can expect therapy to be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Collaborative — we work together</li>
        <li>Respectful — your pace and boundaries matter</li>
        <li>Thoughtful — we make sense of things rather than rushing</li>
        <li>Grounded — insights are connected to real life</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Progress isn’t always linear. There may be periods of clarity, difficulty, or uncertainty. All of that is part of the process.</p>
      <h2>What Is Expected of You</h2>
      <p>Therapy works best when you are willing to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Show up honestly, even when things feel unclear</li>
        <li>Speak up if something doesn’t feel right</li>
        <li>Stay curious about your experience</li>
        <li>Treat therapy as a shared process</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You are never expected to push yourself faster than feels safe or to agree with anything that doesn’t fit your experience.</p>

      <h2>Working with Patterns, Meaning, and Inner Systems</h2>
      <p>Most people come to therapy not because something is “wrong,” but because familiar ways of living no longer work. Patterns that once protected, motivated, or organized life begin to feel constraining. This often shows up during transitions—identity shifts, losses, ruptures, moments of awe, or encounters with injustice—when old assumptions about who you are and how life should be lived stop holding.</p>
      <p>I work from an existential and Internal Family Systems–informed perspective. From an existential view, distress is understood as a meaningful response to real conditions: choice, responsibility, loss, freedom, isolation, and the search for purpose. From an IFS-informed view, inner conflict is understood as the interaction of protective and vulnerable parts of the self—each with a history, a function, and a logic of its own.</p>
      <p>Rather than trying to eliminate symptoms or “fix” parts of you, we slow down and get curious about how your inner system has adapted to your life. We explore which patterns still serve you, which no longer do, and what they are trying to protect. As clarity increases, choice expands. Therapy becomes a space where new ways of relating—to yourself, to others, and to the realities of your life—can emerge deliberately rather than reactively.</p>
      <p>The goal is not to become someone else. It is to live with greater alignment between your values, your actions, and the life you are actually in.</p>

      <h2>More About How I Practice</h2>
      <h3>My Clinical Orientation</h3>
      <p>Non-pathologizing. You are more than a diagnosis. Distress is approached as intelligible and contextual, not as evidence of defect. We focus on increasing awareness, flexibility, and agency rather than labeling or reducing you to symptoms.</p>
      <p>Integrative and individualized. My work is trauma-informed, humanistic, and existential at its core. I primarily draw from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Internal Family Systems–informed therapy</li>
        <li>Client-centered therapy</li>
        <li>Somatic approaches</li>
        <li>Emotion-focused therapy</li>
        <li>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy</li>
        <li>Logotherapy</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Interventions are chosen collaboratively, based on your needs, capacities, and goals—not a preset protocol.</p>
      <h3>Anti-Oppression and Cultural Humility</h3>
      <p>Psychological suffering does not occur in a vacuum. Systems of power, exclusion, and historical harm shape both internal experience and external constraint. I practice from a stance of cultural humility and an intersectional perspective, recognizing how oppression impacts the body, nervous system, identity, and sense of possibility.</p>
      <p>My work is guided by the following commitments:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Naming and addressing how systemic oppression contributes to trauma and distress</li>
        <li>Attending to identity, power, and context in the therapeutic relationship</li>
        <li>Minimizing re-traumatization and respecting protective strategies as adaptive responses</li>
        <li>Locating experience within historical, cultural, and geographic realities</li>
        <li>Supporting empowerment-centered change while maintaining accountability</li>
        <li>Understanding resistance and resilience as meaningful responses, not obstacles</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These principles are not abstract values; they shape how therapy is paced, how safety is built, and how meaning and agency are reclaimed.</p>

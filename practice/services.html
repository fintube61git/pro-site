      <h2>Individual Therapy</h2>
      <p>Individual therapy is a collaborative process of understanding, meaning-making, and choice. Rather than starting from diagnoses or labels, I focus on understanding how you make sense of your life, your relationships, and your inner world—and how that understanding may no longer fit who you are becoming.</p>
      <p>Sessions are structured but responsive. We begin with what feels most important or alive for you in the present moment. I listen carefully and without agenda, working to understand you as you want to be understood. From an Internal Family Systems–informed perspective, we pay attention to different parts of you—protective strategies, inner conflicts, vulnerable experiences—not as problems to eliminate, but as meaningful responses shaped by your history and circumstances.</p>
      <p>From an existential perspective, we also attend to questions of identity, responsibility, loss, freedom, and values. Together, we examine the stories you’ve lived by, where they came from, and whether they still serve you. Therapy is not about becoming someone else; it is about living more deliberately and with greater alignment between your values and your actions.</p>
      <p>We regularly reflect on how the work is going. Each session ends with space to review what was helpful, what wasn’t, and how the process can better support you moving forward.</p>
      <p>I work with adults (18+) around concerns including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Life transitions and disruptions (grief, serious illness, career change, retirement)</li>
        <li>Identity exploration and shifts (gender, sexuality, aging, spirituality)</li>
        <li>Relationship difficulties (family, friendships, work, intimate partnerships)</li>
        <li>Trauma, including complex and developmental trauma</li>
        <li>Ongoing patterns of anxiety, shame, low self-worth, or emotional constriction</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Assessments &amp; Gender-Affirming Care</h2>
      <p>I provide adult readiness evaluations for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and gender-affirming surgeries. These assessments are conducted from a non-pathologizing, affirming, and informed-consent–oriented perspective.</p>
      <p>The evaluation process is collaborative and respectful. My role is not to gatekeep identity, but to support clarity, readiness, and informed decision-making while meeting required standards of care. I also offer ongoing therapeutic support for adults exploring their own gender identity or navigating related relational, familial, or social concerns, including support for partners, family members, and allies.</p>

      <h2>Areas of Focus</h2>
      <p>I commonly work with concerns related to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Anxiety and depression</li>
        <li>Shame and low self-esteem</li>
        <li>Complex trauma</li>
        <li>Identity development (gender, sexuality, aging, spirituality/religion)</li>
        <li>Loss (death, health, career, financial stability)</li>
        <li>Relationship transitions (divorce, separation, infidelity, empty nest)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I provide affirming care for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>LGBTQIA+ individuals</li>
        <li>Gender-diverse and transgender adults</li>
        <li>Consensual non-monogamy, polyamory, and kink-aware clients</li>
      </ul>

## CV Workflow (Non-Negotiable)

- Canonical CV is website-rendered Markdown.
- Do NOT use pandoc or wkhtmltopdf as a CV PDF pipeline.
- If a PDF is needed, open the CV page in a browser and use Print/Save as PDF.
- Do not troubleshoot PDF toolchains unless Dawson explicitly reverses this decision in the current session.
